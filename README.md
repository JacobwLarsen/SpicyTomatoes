#  SpicyTomatoes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spicy Tomatoes marks my **first** github repository. 
It is a simple python website mockup for displaying movie trailers.

##  Execute:
  1. Clone the repository or download it into the chosen directory: 
  `git clone <url>`
  2. From the command line and while in the directory, execute the python file:
  `python entertainment_center.py`
  3. A browser tab will open with the site.
  
##  Note:

The sidebar navigation is for show only, as this is mainly just a mockup design and practice in python.

##  Thanks

A special thanks to Udacity for the backbones of the fresh_tomatoes.py code,
which is used in their [**Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.**](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

##  Contributions 

Contributions can be made if desired, although the purpose of this project was to:
  1. design a mockup
  2. learn to use GitHub
  3. learn more about the development process
  
##  Licensing
  
Open and free usage.
  
###  Hope you enjoy,
